The script 'submissible.sh' contains all required information
to run and build the code. If required, give it execution
permission:

	user:~$ chmod +x submissible.sh

Then run the script to build the code, and execute all tests:

	user:~$ ./submissible.sh


If you want to run this against any other file, it pulls from stdin:

	user:~$ cat different/test/file | ./scan
